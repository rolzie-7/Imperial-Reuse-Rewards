# Reusable Container Reward App 🎁🌱

This is a sustainability-focused web application designed to **encourage the use of reusable food and drink containers** by offering **rewards** to users who bring their own cups or lunchboxes when purchasing from participating outlets on campus.

---

## 💡 Why We Designed This

Single-use containers contribute significantly to waste on campus. Many students and staff at Imperial College London have expressed frustration about having to carry used coffee cups or food containers for long periods when bins are unavailable.

This app was created to:
- **Reduce food packaging waste**
- **Encourage environmentally responsible behavior**
- **Reward users with redeemable points** for making sustainable choices

Points can be exchanged for **coupons usable at Taste Imperial outlets**, helping to make eco-friendly habits more rewarding.

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project is being developed in collaboration with:

- **Imperial College London's Waste and Recycling Team**
- **Taste Imperial**
- With future plans to integrate the app into **myImperial**, the official Imperial College London mobile platform

## 📱 How to Use

Although this is currently a **web-based app**, it’s fully mobile-friendly.
